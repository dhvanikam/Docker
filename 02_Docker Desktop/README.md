# Docker Desktop

## Overview of Docker Desktop
Docker Desktop is a one-click-install application for your Mac, Linux, or Windows environment that lets you build, share, and run containerized applications and microservices.

It provides a straightforward GUI (Graphical User Interface) that lets you manage your containers, applications, and images directly from your machine. You can use Docker Desktop either on its own or as a complementary tool to the CLI.

Docker Desktop reduces the time spent on complex setups so you can focus on writing code. It takes care of port mappings, file system concerns, and other default settings, and is regularly updated with bug fixes and security updates.

* The **Containers**view provides a runtime view of all your containers and applications. It allows you to interact with containers and applications, and manage the lifecycle of your applications directly from your machine.
  
* The **Images** view displays a list of your Docker images and allows you to run an image as a container, pull the latest version of an image from Docker Hub, and inspect images. It also displays a summary of image vulnerabilities.
  
* The **Volumes** view displays a list of volumes and allows you to easily create and delete volumes and see which ones are being used.
  
* The **Builds** view lets you inspect your build history and manage builders. By default, it displays a list of all your ongoing and completed builds.
  

In addition, the Docker Dashboard allows you to:

Navigate to the **Settings menu** to configure your Docker Desktop settings. Select the Settings icon in the Dashboard header.

Access the **Troubleshoot menu** to debug and perform restart operations. Select the Troubleshoot icon in the Dashboard header.

Be notified of new releases, installation progress updates, and more in the Notifications center. Select the **bell icon** in the bottom-right corner of the Docker Dashboard to access the notification center.

Access the **Learning center** from the Dashboard header. It helps you get started with quick in-app walkthroughs and provides other resources for learning about Docker.
